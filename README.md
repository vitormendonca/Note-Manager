# Note-Manager
Very rustic and simple. It was my first project in my learning process on Javascript.
It has a search filter, to filter titles of notes. You can add, or remove a note. 
I made a simple input just to finish and have a real look of a note.
Enter or Click to enable to edit text/input.

Very useful project to develop and learn Javascript DOM. I could use a lot of variety of the DOM.
